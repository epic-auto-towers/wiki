If the effect of any Tower happens with some probability,
that probability is multiplied by 1.25

At the end of the turn, gives a random [Horse Tower](/towers/horse-tower)
+4 {{< icon dmg >}} to damage and +4 {{< icon hp >}} to HP.

If the [Horse Tower](/towers/horse-tower) is not present, gives +(1-3) {{< icon "dmg" >}} to damage
and +(1-3) {{< icon "hp" >}} to HP to another random Tower.
These are permanent bonuses.
