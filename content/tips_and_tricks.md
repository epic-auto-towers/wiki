The Game has a lot of fun tricks one can use to get advantages in the runs.

## Rerolling the start bonus

You can reroll the start bonus by starting the round and quickly going back to the main menu. 
It's important to open the settings before the towers apear in the store. 
If that happens the trick won't work.

If you have a bonus where a specific tower or relic is mentioned you can also reroll that.
You can do this by just going back to the main menu without going into a round.
