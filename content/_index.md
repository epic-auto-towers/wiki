## What is Epic Auto Towers

Epic Auto Towers is a single player/turn based strategy game that combines elements of auto combat, deck builder and roguelites. You can buy different types of towers and create the strongest combinations to stop the waves of monsters. You can discover new tower combinations with each new playthrough.

## Guides

You can find guides for the game on the steam [community hub](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2116060/guides/).
There are also alot of Youtubers that do video guides for the game. Maybe at some point guides will also be added here. 

## Why did i do this?

I wanted to give the community a way to lookup the towers without having to find them in the game. This is also for the people that don't have the game and want to explore the towers.
